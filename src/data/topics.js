    detailedDescription: "Sustainable agriculture meets society's food needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It integrates three main goals: environmental health, economic profitability, and social equity. Practices include crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, integrated pest management, and organic farming. These approaches maintain soil health, conserve water, reduce chemical inputs, and support biodiversity.",

    detailedDescription: "Climate change is causing widespread impacts across natural and human systems. These include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, shifting ecosystems, and threats to food and water security. Adaptation strategies involve adjusting to actual or expected climate effects to minimize harm, while mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Both approaches are necessary to address the climate crisis.",
